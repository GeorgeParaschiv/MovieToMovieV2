# Movie-To-Movie-Solver
This is an algorithm that uses the TMDB API to calculate all chains of length 1 and 2 between 2 movies.

Daily mode finds the solutions from the daily challenge on movietomovie.com.
Custom mode allows the user to search for and pick any start or end movie.

This requires a TMDB API Key in order to function properly. My personal api key and login info is stored seperately in a config.py file.

**WARNING** 
*Chains of length 2 and greater may take up to an hour to complete.*
